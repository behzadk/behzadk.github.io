Hi, I'm Behzad. I'm a research scientist, software developer and entrepreneur. I use maths and computing to explain biological systems, and predict their behaviour.

During my experiences in academia and industry, I have developed expertise in Bayesian statistics and machine learning applied to microbial communities, computer vision, sentiment analysis and model optimization problems.

# Publication Highlights

### Automated design of synthetic micobial communities
I developed AutoCD, software and methodology to design microbial communities with defined population dynamics! 

Using non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) we were able to derive interaciton motifs, showing the types of microbial interactions that are necessary to produce stable multistrain communities

### Single strain control of microbial consortia
Alex Fedorec designed a two-strain community by engineering a strain of E. coli to secrete a toxin in response to competition. We applied AutoCD to compare Alex's design with other possible engineering options. 

We found that Alex's design was the simplest solution to producing co-existence (iv). AutoCD showed us how we can add more parts to produce a more robust co-existence with higher tunability.

### Chaos in small microbial communities
Here we demonstrated that chaotic behaviour can occur in small microbial communities. We use approximate Bayesian computation to find the interaction networks that are most likely to produce chaotic behaviour
