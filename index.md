Hi, I'm Behzad. I'm a research scientist, software developer and entrepreneur. I use maths and computing to explain biological systems, and predict their behaviour.

During my experiences in academia and industry, I have developed expertise in Bayesian statistics and machine learning applied to microbial communities, computer vision, sentiment analysis and model optimization problems. Check out my CV for an overview! -- LINK

## Automated design of synthetic micobial communities
I developed AutoCD, software and methodology to design microbial communities with defined population dynamics! Checkout the paper here: [Automated design of synthetic micobial communities](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-20756-2)

Using non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) we were able to derive interaciton motifs, showing the types of microbial interactions that are necessary to produce stable multistrain communities

## Single strain control of microbial consortia
Alex Fedorec designed a two-strain community by engineering a strain of E. coli to secrete a toxin in response to competition. We applied AutoCD to compare Alex's design with other possible engineering options. 

We found that Alex's design was the simplest solution to producing co-existence (iv). AutoCD showed us how we can add more parts to produce a more robust co-existence with higher tunability.

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

<dl>
<dt>Name</dt>
<dd>Godzilla</dd>

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
